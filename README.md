# Forta Agent CLI

## Installation

To install locally, run `npm install`, `npm run build` and then `npm run publish:local` (which just runs `npm link`). This will create a symlink to the local `dist` folder. You should only need to symlink once, and then any changes you make to the `dist` folder should be in effect

## Commands

After installing, you should have the `forta-agent` tool available. To see the possible commands, run `forta-agent help`. You can also see options for specific commands (e.g. `forta-agent test help`)
